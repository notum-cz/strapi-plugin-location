# Strapi Plugin Location

This plugin allows users to create location inputs and store latitude and longitude values as geometry types in a PostGIS database. It also provides functionality to filter items based on their location.

## Caution 🖐⚠️

This plugin requires a PostgreSQL database with the PostGIS extension enabled (can be used on that database plugin will enable it for you if it can). Make sure you have a compatible database set up before using this plugin. For development I used postgis docker image from here: https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/postgis/postgis/

⚠️ Filtering by data in relations is not supported.

## We've released v2.x for Strapi V5
The version 2.x for this plugin is aimed at Strapi V5. If you need to use this plugin for Strapi V4, please install the 1.x releases of the plugin. With this upgrade:

- The plugin uses Strapi V5's plugin SDK library `@strapi/sdk-plugin`.
- The plugin now works based on the `documentId` attribute

## 🙉 What does the plugin do for you?

- ✅ Provides a custom location input field for latitude and longitude values
- ✅ Display the location on a map and fine-tune it by moving a marker using drag-and-drop functionality, all without the need for a Google Maps API key.
- ✅ Handles storage of location values as geometry types in a PostGIS database
- ✅ Allows filtering of items based on their location
- ✅ Enables searching for items with the same location or within a specified range

## 🧑‍💻 Installation

1. Install the package with your preferred package manager using one of the commands bellow:

```
npm i @notum-cz/strapi-plugin-location
```
```
yarn add @notum-cz/strapi-plugin-location
```
2. Create or modify file `config/plugins.js` and include the following code snippet:

```
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
	"location-plugin": {
		enabled:  true,
	},
});
```
3. run `npm build` or `yarn build` to get the plugin activated in the admin UI
4. extend `config/middlewares.js` as shown in this example:

```
export default [
  "strapi::errors",
  {
    name: "strapi::security",
    config: {
      contentSecurityPolicy: {
        useDefaults: true,
        directives: {
          "connect-src": ["'self'", "https:"],
          "img-src": [
            "'self'",
            "data:",
            "blob:",
            "https://market-assets.strapi.io",
            "https://tile.openstreetmap.org",
            "https://a.tile.openstreetmap.org",
            "https://b.tile.openstreetmap.org",
            "https://c.tile.openstreetmap.org",
          ],
          "media-src": ["'self'", "data:", "blob:"],
          upgradeInsecureRequests: null,
        },
      },
    },
  },
  "strapi::cors",
  "strapi::poweredBy",
  "strapi::logger",
  "strapi::query",
  "strapi::body",
  "strapi::session",
  "strapi::favicon",
  "strapi::public",
];
```
## ⚙️ Usage
 - To use a custom input field for latitude and longitude go to the Content-type-builder of your application –> select a desired content-type -> click add another field -> select Cutstom tab -> name the field and hit the save button.
 - To search or filter items based on their location use url parameter `location` in the following formats.

For example for a content-type named *Restaurant* with a field *coords* containing the coordinates the url with the location query would be:

`localhost:1337/api/restaurants?$location[coords]=49.200949303006055,16.623833585841673,5000`

This will return a list of restaurants within 5000m of the point specified by the coordinates. **Replace the collection name *restaurant* and the field name *coords* with the name of your collection name and the field containing the coordinates**. The last number (5000) is range and is not required.
Also this format is supported:

`localhost:1337/api/restaurants?$location[coords][lat]=49.200949303006055&$location[coords][lng]=16.623833585841673`
