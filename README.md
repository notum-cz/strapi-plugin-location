# Strapi Plugin Location

This plugin allows users to create location inputs and store latitude and longitude values as geometry types in a PostGIS database. It also provides functionality to filter items based on their location.

## Caution 🖐⚠️

This plugin requires a PostgreSQL database with the PostGIS extension enabled (can be used on that database plugin will enable it for you if it can). Make sure you have a compatible database set up before using this plugin. For development I used postgis docker image from here: https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/postgis/postgis/

⚠️ Filtering by data in relations is not supported.

## 🙉 What does the plugin do for you?

- ✅ Provides a custom location input field for latitude and longitude values
- ✅ Display the location on a map and fine-tune it by moving a marker using drag-and-drop functionality, all without the need for a Google Maps API key.
- ✅ Handles storage of location values as geometry types in a PostGIS database
- ✅ Allows filtering of items based on their location
- ✅ Enables searching for items with the same location or within a specified range

## 🧑‍💻 Installation

1. Install the package with your preferred package manager using one of the commands bellow:

```
npm i @notum-cz/strapi-plugin-location
```
```
yarn add @notum-cz/strapi-plugin-location
```
2. Create or modify file `config/plugins.js` and include the following code snippet:

```
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
	"location-plugin": {
		enabled:  true,
	},
});
```
3. run `npm build` or `yarn build` to get the plugin activated in the admin UI
4. extend `config/middlewares.js` as shown in this example:

```
export default [
  "strapi::errors",
  {
    name: "strapi::security",
    config: {
      contentSecurityPolicy: {
        useDefaults: true,
        directives: {
          "connect-src": ["'self'", "https:"],
          "img-src": [
            "'self'",
            "data:",
            "blob:",
            "https://market-assets.strapi.io",
            "https://tile.openstreetmap.org",
            "https://a.tile.openstreetmap.org",
            "https://b.tile.openstreetmap.org",
            "https://c.tile.openstreetmap.org",
          ],
          "media-src": ["'self'", "data:", "blob:"],
          upgradeInsecureRequests: null,
        },
      },
    },
  },
  "strapi::cors",
  "strapi::poweredBy",
  "strapi::logger",
  "strapi::query",
  "strapi::body",
  "strapi::session",
  "strapi::favicon",
  "strapi::public",
];
```
## ⚙️ Usage
 - To use a custom input field for latitude and longitude go to the Content-type-builder of your application –> select a desired content-type -> click add another field -> select Cutstom tab -> name the field and hit the save button.
 - To search or filter items based on their location use url parameter `location` in the following formats.

For example for a content-type named *Restaurant* with a field *coords* containing the coordinates the url with the location query would be:

`localhost:1337/api/restaurants?$location[coords]=49.200949303006055,16.623833585841673,5000`

This will return a list of restaurants within 5000m of the point specified by the coordinates. **Replace the collection name *restaurant* and the field name *coords* with the name of your collection name and the field containing the coordinates**. The last number (5000) is range and is not required.
Also this format is supported:

`localhost:1337/api/restaurants?$location[coords][lat]=49.200949303006055&$location[coords][lng]=16.623833585841673`
